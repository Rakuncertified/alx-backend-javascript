# TypeScript Learning Repository

This repository contains a series of tasks to help you learn and practice TypeScript. Each task is designed to cover different aspects of TypeScript, from basic type declarations to more advanced topics.

## Task List

### Task 0: Creating an interface for a student

In the `task_0` directory, you will find a script that introduces you to TypeScript interfaces. Follow the instructions to create an interface named `Student` and render a table with student information.

### Task 1: Building Teacher interfaces

In the `task_1` directory, you'll work on building interfaces for teachers. You'll create a `Teacher` interface and extend it with a `Directors` interface.

### Task 2: Advanced TypeScript

In the `task_2` directory, you'll dive into advanced TypeScript concepts. You'll implement classes, interfaces, and functions for different employee types and work tasks.

### Task 3: Ambient Namespaces

The `task_3` directory introduces you to ambient namespaces and interaction with external libraries. You'll save entities to a database using the `crud.js` library.

### Task 4: Namespace & Declaration Merging

In the `task_4` directory, you'll work with TypeScript namespaces and declaration merging. You'll define interfaces, classes, and methods related to subjects and teachers.

### Task 5: Brand Convention & Nominal Typing

The `task_5` directory explores brand convention and nominal typing. You'll create interfaces with branded properties and functions to sum credits for major and minor subjects.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the specific task directory you want to work on, e.g., `task_0`.

3. Follow the instructions in the README.md file within that directory to complete the task.

4. Make use of TypeScript to ensure type safety and follow best practices in your code
